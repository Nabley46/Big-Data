# Tostitos- The Legend
> Hello, My name is Jacob Culp, and my fellow researchers consist of Nabor Leyva and Juan Carbajal. Today, we would like to present to you, the viewers why **Tostidos** is the best brand?

> This project asked us to use *Google Trends* to find information for certain topics and talk to real-life companies about potential ways to improve upon their pre-existing buisness model. We chose Tostidos as our primary focus of our research and searched google trends to find when and when people search for these tasty chips.
## The results may shock you

Tostitos is such a familiar brand that we have never really thought of how it is around the world. That is the reason why we decided to research over the tositos brand. Once we began our research, we immediately conducted our primary research in google trends. Our results primarily taught us that their primary audience/ consumer base lies in North America (United states of America, Mexico, and Canada).
